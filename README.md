# GDM

This is a medical application for Dr. Steinberg. The basic functionality of the app is for patients with
gestational diabetes to monitor their blood sugars. The app is simple, it allows the patient to enter
a blood sugar one at a time, along with the time of day and what kind of reading it is (before a meal,
after a meal, before bed, after waking up). As of right now, I have been experimenting with how to
make the app navigable. After playing with SwiftUI, I started making some headway in adding
buttons and a date picker. Ultimately, the app will also allow the user to view a graph of their sugars
and send an e-mail of the report to their doctor.

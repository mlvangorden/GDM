# GDM

This is a medical application for Dr. Steinberg. The basic functionality of the app is for patients with
gestational diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels. The app is simple; it allows the patient to enter
a blood sugar one at a time, along with the time of day and what kind of reading it is (before a meal,
after a meal, before bed, after waking up). I used SwiftUI to build it, and I learned much about how SwiftUI
works, its advantages, its disadvantages.
After a user inputs their blood sugar levels for the day, they are able to view a report of their sugar
levels within a date range with a bar graph that shows their daily averages for each kind of reading. The
patient can then send an email of their report to their doctor that specifies the date range, the percentage
of readings that were within the target threshold, and a list of every reading within that range.
This has been a rewarding experience in which I learned plenty about what apps are capable of and what I am
capable of as a developer. The app is basically finished, all that is left is to tweak some of the visual
aspects of the application as well as add disclaimers and basic documentation in the other tabs of the
app.
